  /**
   * This class contains a Two-dimensional kernels for image sharpening, base
   * on "Unsharp mask and high-boost filtering".
   *
   * A common technique for sharp images is "unsharp mask", it consist of 
   * subtracting a blurred version of an image from the image itself. This
   * is expressed as
   *
   * \f[f_{s}(x,y)=f(x,y)-\bar{f}(x,y)\f]
   *
   * where \f$ f_{s}(x,y)\f$ denotes the sharpened image obteined by unsharp 
   * masking, and \f$ \bar{f}(x,y)\f$ is a blurred version of \f$ f(x,y) \f$.
   *
   * A generalization of upsharp masking is called high-boost filtering, that
   * is defined as
   *
   * \f[f_{hb}(x,y)=Af(x,y)-\bar{f}(x,y)\f]
   *
   * where \f$ A \ge 1 \f$. Reordening we obtain,
   *
   * \f[f_{hb}(x,y)=f(x,y)*A-f(x,y)*g(x,y)\f]
   * \f[f_{hb}(x,y)=f(x,y)*[A\delta(x,y)-g(x,y)]\f]
   *
   * This means that to obtain a sharp image in needed to convolve the image
   * with \f$ [A\delta(x,y)-g(x,y)] \f$, where \f$ g(x,y)\f$ is a laplacian or
   * gaussian kernel.
   *
   * This class implements the kernel define by \f$ [A\delta(x,y)-g(x,y)] \f$.
   * The parameters define the size, the constan A, the type (laplacian or
   * gaussian) and the type of neighbor (four or eight).
   * 
   * This is an example of a 3x3 four neighbor laplacian sharpening kernel:
   * \code
   *  0    -1    0
   * -1    A+4  -1
   *  0    -1    0
   * \endcode
   *
   * This is an example of a 3x3 eight neigbor laplacian sharpening kernel:
   * \code
   * -1    -1   -1
   * -1    A+8  -1
   * -1    -1   -1
   * \endcode
   *
   * To convolve a mask based on laplacian kernel with a channel follow the 
   * next example
   *
   * \code
   * // the channel to be filtered:
   * lti::channel data;
   *
   * // ... initialize channel here ...
   *
   * // laplacian filter kernel with dimensions 3x3, high boost constant 
   * // and four neighbor type
   * lti::sharpeningKernels kernel(3,1.1,sharpeningKernels::Laplacian,
   * sharpeningKernels::FourNeighbor);
   *
   * // convolution operator
   * lti::convolution filter(kernel);                       
   *
   * // filter the channel to sharp it
   * filter.apply(data);
   * \endcode
   *
   * To convolve a mask based on gaussian kernel with a channel follow the 
   * next example
   *
   * \code
   * // the channel to be filtered:
   * lti::channel data;
   *
   * // ... initialize channel here ...
   *
   * // laplacian filter kernel with dimensions 3x3, high boost constant 1.1
   * // and variance 5.0
   * lti::sharpening kernel(3,1.1,sharpeningKernels::Gaussian,5.0);
   *
   * // convolution operator
   * lti::convolution filter(kernel);                       
   *
   * // filter the channel to sharp it
   * filter.apply(data);
   * \endcode
   *
   * Note: The convolution with this kernels could gives values under zero 
   * or above the top limit of the type (>1 in floats or >255 in ubytes).
   * Thus, you have to crop it!.
