Simple example for integration of the LTI-Lib-2 with Qt

This example provides an idea of how to configure a project using qmake
to integrate the LTI-Lib-2.

Please check the file Qt-LTILib.pro for a basic configuration example.

How to compile
--------------

Just call qmake and then use the generated Makefile:

> qmake
> make

The executables will be left in the corresponding directories in "build". 
For instance, you can call the debug version with

> ./build/debug/Qt-LTILib

The program will open a simple window with a label "This is a label", on which
an image can be displayed.  In the menu "Test" you can call a method which
prints in the console a vector or a matrix, or just displays on the label
a simple lti::image filled with a random color.

How to convert an lti::image to Qt types
----------------------------------------

The files ltiQt.h and ltiQt.cpp contain simple conversion functions.  More
efficient methods should exist.
