Implementation of the NSGA-II Algorithm in the library Lti-Lib2.


For installation:

Replace the folder /misc in the source installation of the LTI-LIB2 already installed in your computer.

To test the Algorithm you can replace the folder /examples/basicGeneticOptimization of your Lti-lib2 /examples folder, you can specify

the algorithm tou want to use (PESA or NSGA-II) by modifiying the file "pareto_basic.cfg" and setting the parameters in the 

next way:

For PESA execution: 

(engineName "PESA")
(engineParamFile "pesa.cfg")


For NSGA-II execution:

(engineName "NSGA2")
(engineParamFile "nsga2.cfg")
