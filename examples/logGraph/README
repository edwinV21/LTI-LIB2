Pareto Front

This example creates GNU-Plot files for the output of the examples using a
lti::paretoFront derived class (see example cwagmeval).

It can generate graphics for 2D and 3D Pareto Fronts.

After compiling (just execute "make") you need a data file (pareto.log,
pareto.log.pf or similar) for which the front will be generated.

As an example:  if you executed the cwagmeval example then just do 

> pareto -p test.gp -x ../cwagmeval/pareto.log.pf

This will create a GNU-Plot script test.gp that can be executed with

> gnuplot -persist test.gp

  (you can close the window presing 'q')

You can edit test.gp to fit your need, and as a hint, if you replace -x with
-f, the generated script will instruct gnuplot to export an xfig file or with
-e an eps file.

You can specify several files at the same time, so that different fronts are
plotted on the same graphic.  With -a you can also get the front of all
fronts.
